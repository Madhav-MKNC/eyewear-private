# The problem eye-PERS solves
We are solving the ambiguity problem in choosing the frames while ordering spectacles. Generally, with popular eyewear-selling companies like Lenskart, we don't get personal recommendations. The recommendation is only based on the site's best sellers, which may not be an excellent fit for a particular person. We solve this problem by analysing the person's facial features and using these features and artificial intelligence to recommend what's best for a given person.
